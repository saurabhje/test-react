        This simple concept of "manually copying text from one place and pasting
        it elsewhere" has been in practice since the innovation of basic
        text-editing commands (copy/cut/paste) in the early 1980s and subsequent
        rise of spamming in the early 1990s. In 1974, American computer
        scientist Larry Tesler, widely cited as the pioneer of "cut and paste"
        commands, first transferred the function into a computer text-editing
        software.[1]

        The origin of the term "copypasta" is unknown; although, some report to
        seeing the term on Usenet and 4chan imageboards in 2006. Urban
        Dictionary [2] posted the earliest available usage of the term on April
        20th, 2006. User Elexus defined the term, "An amount of lengthy text
        that has been repeatedly copied from somewhere and pasted as a reply to
        an irrelevant subject." The post received more than 170 upvotes in less
        than 15 years (shown below).
